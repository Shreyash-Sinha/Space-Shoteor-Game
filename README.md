# Space-Shooter-Game

This is a small game where there will be two spaceship battlling against each other.
This is a first game I ever build using the pygame module in python. It took me 8 hours to complete this game.

# Basic Overview of Game:

The left spaceship is controlled by WASD keys and the left-control key for shooting. The right spaceship is controlled with the Arrow keys and the right-control key for shooting.
There is a health bar on each side of the screen. The spaceships have a total of 10 HP. Whichever spaceship dies first will be declared as the loser and the opponent will be declared as the winner.

# Run This Code:

In order to run this game, you require to download this folder named Shooting Star and open it. Inside this folder open Windows Powershell or Windows Command Prompt and type 
'python .\main.py' and this game will run and you can enjoy this game.
